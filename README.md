# pianoTeachingAssistant
Most files present are MIDI files to be used in the main code pianoAssistant.py

This project was a part of my school work and originally belonged on my school owned GitHub page, however, since I cannot transfer ownership to my personal GitHub, I have just reuploaded all the files into my GitHub.
